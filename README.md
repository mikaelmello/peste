# sdl-engine

Current repository link: https://github.com/mikaelmello/sdl-engine

Game engined developed in C++ using the SDL library, as part of small projects from the Introduction to Game Development course, from University of Bras√≠lia.

There are seven projects and each one will continue from the previous one, this repository will contain all code from the seven projects, and the versions that are delivered are tagged with major versions from 1 to 7.

Among the tags with the same major version, the one sent for correction will be the one with the highest minor version. For example, `v2.0` was the first revision in which I considered the second project finished, but `v2.1` has a few improvements that I made before the deadline, meaning that `v2.1` is the one actually delivered.
